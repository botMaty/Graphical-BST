# Graphical Binary Search Tree (BST)

This project visualizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) using Python's Tkinter library.

## Project Files:
- `Graphical_BST.py`: Contains the main logic for the BST operations (insert, remove, search).
- `Graphical_BST_show.py`: This file runs the graphical interface, creating a canvas and controlling the interaction with the tree.
- `BST_Icon.png`: The icon used for the application window.

## How to Run:
1. Install Python (version 3.x recommended).
2. Ensure that you have the `tkinter` library installed (usually included with Python).
3. Run `Graphical_BST_show.py` to start the graphical interface.

```bash
python Graphical_BST_show.py
"# Graphical-BST" 
"# Graphical-BST" 
"# Graphical-BST" 
"# Graphical-BST" 
"# Graphical-BST"
